# Beam to Train Station

A mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com).

Formerly known as Teleport to Train Station

You may want to use this mod if answering yes to one or more of the following questions:

-   You have a mega base with a complex and big train network
-   Tired of wandering around your mega base, taking ages to go from one factory to another?
-   Where the heck did I put my Processing Unit factory? (i.e. is taking you a long time to find a factory on your ever expanding map)
-   Have you ever run out of fuel while getting to your destination and finding yourself in the middle of nowhere? Good luck walking all the way back to base and back again to your vehicle

The interface can be opened with the Shortcut keys (default: CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + X), or by clicking on the button ![shortcut-icon](https://github.com/tommasodargenio/syd-beam-to-train-station/blob/main/graphics/icons/teleport-ts-button-icon-16.png) in your shortcut bar.

To add the mod button to the shortcut bar please refer to the [Factorio Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Shortcut_bar)

The mod will show you a list of all your train stations, pick your destination and click the Energy! button to be immediately teleported there. If you are sitting in your vehicle of choice, that will be teleported too. (I'm afraid this is currently not available for Spidertron)

You can use the search button on the top right of the interface to narrow down your train stations list.

# Disclaimer

I'm no mod or LUA expert, while I did my best to extensively test this mod you may still find bugs. If so please don't hesitate to open an issue on my [github](https://github.com/tommasodargenio/syd-beam-to-train-station) page, I will take a look at it as soon as possible - I'd appreciate if you could provide extensive details of the issue, including screenshots if possible.

Be advised, I have not tested this in multiplayer.
